# t5_german_paraphrasing
A finetuned t5 model for german paraphrasing

The Goal of this Notebook is to create a german paraphrasing-tool by finetuning the transformer-based Model T5.

T5 was introduced by Raffel et al. (2019) in "Exploring the Limits of Transfer Learning with a Unified Text-to-Text Transformer".
